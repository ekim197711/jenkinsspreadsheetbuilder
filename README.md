# Jenkins Spreadsheet Builder
This is a open source project with the purpose to create a plugin for jenkins available for sending out sql reports in the .xlsx / .ods format

The project will be coded in groovy and java.
The build engine will be gradle.

This project might be split in 2. The report engine and the Jenkins plugin.

We hope many devlopers will chip in with a contribution of knowledge and skill.
